<h1>LeetCode Solutions</h1>
<p>Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! This repository serves as a <strong>Backup</strong> and a showcase of my journey in solving various coding problems on LeetCode.</p>
    
<h2>Why I am Pushing Each Solution to GitHub</h2>
<p>I've decided to push my solutions to GitHub, even though I've already submitted them on LeetCode, for a few key reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Loss Prevention</strong>: At one point, all my progress on LeetCode vanished unexpectedly. Whether it was due to a session being deleted or some other reason, I lost all my well-maintained solutions that I relied on for revision.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Accessibility</strong>: Storing my solutions locally also proved unreliable, <strong> as files can be lost or corrupted. Keeping my solutions on GitHub ensures they are safe, secure, and easily accessible from anywhere. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Documenting My Journey</strong>: This repository not only serves as a backup but also showcases my growth and progress as a developer. It's a record of the challenges I've tackled and the solutions I've crafted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy coding!</p>
