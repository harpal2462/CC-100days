# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my collection of problems solved during this challenge! This repository serves as a **backup** and a showcase of my journey in solving various coding problems on LeetCode.

## Why I am Pushing Each Solution to GitHub

I've decided to push my solutions to GitHub, even though I've already submitted them on LeetCode, for a few key reasons:

1. **Data Loss Prevention**: At one point, all my progress on LeetCode vanished unexpectedly. Whether it was due to a session being deleted or some other reason, I lost all my well-maintained solutions that I relied on for revision.

2. **Security and Accessibility**: Storing my solutions locally also proved unreliable, as files can be lost or corrupted. Keeping my solutions on GitHub ensures they are safe, secure, and easily accessible from anywhere.

3. **Documenting My Journey**: This repository not only serves as a backup but also showcases my growth and progress as a developer. It's a record of the challenges I've tackled and the solutions I've crafted.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy coding!
